# Ticket Buying API

This project is an API that implements clean architecture principles and allows developers to create various applications for selecting and purchasing tickets. The API separates the concerns of the application and the infrastructure, making it easier to maintain and extend. It also promotes modularity and testability.

Some of the features of the API include:

* User authentication and authorization
* Ability to search for and purchase tickets
* Support for different payment methods
* Integration with external ticket providers

The API is built using modern web technologies such as FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and Postgres and follows best practices for building scalable and performant systems. It can be easily integrated with other systems and can be deployed on a variety of platforms.

Overall, this API provides a solid foundation for building robust and reliable ticket buying applications.
